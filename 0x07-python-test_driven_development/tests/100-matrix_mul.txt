The ``100-matrix_mul`` module
======================

Using ``matrix_mul``
-------------------

This is a doctest test file to test the matrix_mul function in
the module 100-matrix_mul.

	>>> matrix_mul = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul
	>>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]]))
	[[7, 10], [15, 22]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4], [5, 6]]))
	[[13, 16]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul())
	[[1]]
	>>> print(matrix_mul([[1]]))
        [[1]]
